I’m Adrian, and I can help you with bridging the gap between the programming and management worlds. I have almost 10 years of experience working as a  leader and .NET engineer. Here you can find useful and reusable technical solutions which are mostly based on .NET and Azure. I recommend visiting my blog to check the latest leadership articles, which are mixed with technical thoughts. In my free time, I’m an amateur obstacle course runner. I also enjoy playing role-playing games as a dungeon master or just a player.

Do ⭐ my repository if you find my project interesting, at least your star could make someone's day.
